START

1. LOOP:
   a. Ask user: "What is your sentence? Use {} as placeholders"
   b. Store the input in a variable called 'template'

   c. CHECK if:
      - 'template' contains at least one '{}'
      - AND 'template' does NOT contain any '{' without a matching '}'
      - AND 'template' does NOT contain any '}' without a matching '{'
      - AND 'template' does NOT contain things like '{name}' or '{0}', only '{}'

   d. IF the template is valid:
      - BREAK the loop and continue
   e. ELSE:
      - Show an error message like "Invalid input. Please only use empty curly braces {} as placeholders."
      - REPEAT the loop

2. Count how many times '{}' appears in 'template'
   -> Store the number in a variable called 'placeholder_count'

3. Create an empty list called 'values'

4. REPEAT placeholder_count times:
   a. Ask the user: "Enter value for placeholder [number]"
   b. Add the value to the 'values' list

5. Replace the placeholders in 'template' with the values from the list
   -> Use the values in the same order

6. Show the final sentence to the user

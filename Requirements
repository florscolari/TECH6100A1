- welcome message
- Menu with options to run each task
- Exit the program
- Running the program until user’s decision of leaving the program
- Input validation for clean data


## Task 1
Task 1: This function should receive a variable number of positional arguments,
which are numeric values. It should calculate and return the mean, median, and
standard deviation of the given values.

- welcome message for task 1
- Ask for how many numbers the user wants to input
- Run a loop for each of those X qty of numbers, it’ll collect each input and validate that’s a number (Int, float or any other number data type)
- Display invalid input and ask for correction
- Collect arguments in a temporary list
- Perform calculations over that list
- Present summary after taking all the numbers (arguments)
”you have entered this serie of numbers: []
Display results below”

Back to menu or repeat task

## Task 2
Merge dictionaries into a dictionary
- how many dictionaries would you like to merge?
- As for user’s input. Integer number
- Validate a proper input
- Iterate X user has entered
- for each dictionary iteration ask how many key-pair values would like to have for this dictionary?
- User’s input about it
- For each key-value pair iteration ask a value for key and a value for value
- IMPORTANT
must check that the key is not repeated. If the key is the same as an existing key input before, a message informing the user should appear and asking to fix its last value

Then iterates again for the second dictionary and so on…

Temporarily store those dictionaries into a list or dictionary, then pass that in the form of keyword arguments to perform the merge through the function

After all X iterations are done

Display the output in same format as before: this is what you have input, this is the result
